Too Many Cooks
---
This game was written for Ludum Dare 40 over the weekend of December 2nd, 2017 by Liz Izatt.  It references the Too Many Cooks short film that aired on Adult Swim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGrOK8oZG8).

Left mouse button fires the currently equipped gun at the reticle location.  Right mouse button cycles between available weapons.  Spacebar starts the game when at the menu.  Escape or q will quit.
